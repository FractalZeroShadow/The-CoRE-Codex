# A Postcard from the Peak: The World of Thirsty Ghosts

The village below is haunted, but not by the dead. It is haunted by the living. It is a world suffering from Quantum Blindness, a state where it is simultaneously full and empty.

The streets are crowded with thirsty ghosts. They cry out for connection, yet they scroll past each other in silence, searching for a digital echo of the warmth that stands right next to them. They claim to have no time, yet they offer hours of their lives to flickering screens showing stories they do not enjoy. They dream of freedom, but when they find a moment of quiet, they flee from its "emptiness" back into the noise.

This is the state of Quantum Blindness: to be surrounded by the feast you crave, while starving to death because you have forgotten how to eat.

### What does this mean?

The ghosts are not chasing the wrong things. They are chasing the reflection of the right things. They seek the idea of connection in the machine, the distraction from time in the show, the illusion of freedom in the endless scroll.

The cure for this blindness is simple, but not easy. You must be willing to look up from the reflection, and face the terrifying, beautiful, and unscripted reality of the person standing right next to you.
