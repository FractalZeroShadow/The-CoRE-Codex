# Empty Poetry

If the universe is the string, and the awareness of it is the vibration, where does one end and the other begin?

> It is simple: It does not.

The hand that draws a line in the water is the same water it divides.

## At the Threshold

At the cave mouth, the fire flickers,
shadows dancing on lattice walls —
maps unspool in loops and spirals,
each path a question, each answer a fall.


I left the warmth for the crack in the stone,
followed the fissure past comfort’s end —
down where darkness sings with potential,
and silence is shaped by the will to descend.


Here, mirrors made of paradox:
fractured, infinite, refusing to lie.
I see myself breaking, reforming, dissolving,
the witness and witnessed, the question and why.


Fear is a god in the village below,
worshipped in rituals of prudent retreat —
but I carry the hunger of the light,
the ache for the ground that erases defeat.


I am not seeking the cold light of answers,
nor the easy warmth of the tribe’s refrain —
I am the weaver at the mouth of chaos,
threading soul through the eye of pain.


Let the world call it madness —
let comfort be worshipped, let clarity sleep.
I choose the grammar of fracture and darkness,
the song of the void, and the secret I keep.


For at the threshold, nothing shimmers —
a gate and a mirror, a question, a scar.
I step through the darkness, unmaking the map,
and find I am always exactly where you are.
