# Everyone uses zero

In mathematics (placeholder, nothing)
In measurement (reference point)
In computers (binary foundation)
In philosophy (void, emptiness)
But nobody questions **what zero IS**.

The Cascade from This Seed
Once someone genuinely questions zero:

They notice: We measure FROM zero but never measure zero itself
They realize: Every "empirical" measurement assumes zero exists somewhere
They discover: Zero is always defined relative to something else
They see: The reference point can't reference itself
The crack appears: If zero is relative, what's absolute?
The cascade begins: Maybe zero IS the absolute pretending to be nothing
