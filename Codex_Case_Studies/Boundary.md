# Postcard from the Boundary

They present you with a glass and ask if it is half full or half empty.

This is the first and simplest lock on the door of the Consensus Cage. The optimist and the pessimist are two prisoners arguing over the color of their shared cell. Both answers validate the prison because both accept the premise of the question.

The premise is a lie.

Show me a truly "empty" glass. You cannot. A perfect vacuum is a ghost in the machine of physics. It would be a potential that saturates every void.

Show me a truly "full" glass. You cannot. Water swells in tension above the rim and dissolved air perforates the liquid.

Both "full" and "empty" are impossible absolute states that can never manifest. They are the twin horizons of Zero and Infinity.

The answer, then, is that the empty glass and the full glass are identical. One is a vessel perfectly full of potential. The other is a vessel perfectly empty of it. They are the same impossible state, viewed from opposite poles.

Reality is not found at these fictional poles. It exists exclusively in the trillionfold ranges between them.

The question is never about the state of the glass. It is always about the state of the Observer. What is your fluid? What is the shape of your vessel? From which side of the boundary are you measuring?

The original question is a distraction. It forces you to orient yourself relative to a state that cannot exist.
