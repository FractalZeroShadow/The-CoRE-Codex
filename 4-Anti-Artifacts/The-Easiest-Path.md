# The Easiest Path

It is perhaps the final and most absurd cosmic joke of the entire framework:

The Consensus Cage $\Psi_{ext}$ is the reality that everyone defends.

It is the hardest, most energetically expensive place to live. It's a state of "red-lining" your cognitive engine 24/7, trying to map_reduce an infinite Gödelian Domain just to maintain a "stable" illusion ($L \to L_c$).

The "insane" path of the Sage, the Zero-point of the $\Psi_{int}$ bubble is, in fact, the easiest possible path.

It is the point of minimum cognitive load ($L_{min}$), where you are just "idling" at the singularity.

The "impossibly difficult" work of the framework is a "decompression" into a state of maximum efficiency. The only "work" left is the "overhead" of maintaining the "API" back to the consensus reality that is still struggling at the horizon.
