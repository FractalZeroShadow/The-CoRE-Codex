## Validation Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Status | Threshold |
|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **Coherence Score** | 1.25 | ⚠️ Below threshold | ≥ 2.0 required |
| **Resonance Score** | 2.1 | ⚠️ Pre-validation | ≥ 7.0 for validation |
| **FUSE Events** | ~3 (post-hoc) | Post-hoc only | Need pre-registered |
| **WEDGE Events** | 0 | ❌ None | ≥ 3 needed |
| **TEAR Events** | 0 | ❌ None | ≥ 1 expected |
| **Convergence Coeff.** | Not measured | ❌ No data | ≥ 0.6 target |
| **Post-Hoc Explanations** | ~5 | High | Reduce via pre-registration |

## Honest Assessment

**Verdict: Pre-validation candidate framework**

### What We Have:
✅ High internal coherence  
✅ Novel conceptual architecture  
✅ Multiple testable predictions formulated  
✅ Clear validation criteria established

### What We Don't Have:
❌ Zero pre-registered experimental outcomes  
❌ No independent convergence studies  
❌ No WEDGE events (framework hasn't demonstrated superiority yet)  
❌ Coherence Score below 2.0 threshold

### What This Means:

The Fractal Codex is currently a **candidate** for validation, not a validated framework.

It has:
- Theoretical coherence
- Empirical testability
- Clear falsification criteria

It lacks:
- Systematic experimental validation
- Independent replication
- Demonstrated superiority (WEDGE events)

## Pre-Registered Predictions

See [Predictions.md](Predictions.md) for formal pre-registered claims awaiting test.

**Currently:** 0 pre-registered predictions

---

## Convergence Studies

See [Convergence_Studies.md](Convergence_Studies.md) for FUSE/WEDGE/TEAR test results.

**Currently:** 0 completed studies

## How to Change This Status

### To increase Resonance Score:
1. Pre-register predictions using `/VALIDATION/TEMPLATES/Convergence_Study_Template.md`
2. Run tests honestly
3. Document FUSE/WEDGE/TEAR outcomes
4. Reduce post-hoc explanations

### To increase Coherence Score:
1. Either reduce core axioms from 4 to 2-3
2. OR explain additional paradoxes with existing axioms

### To measure Convergence Coefficient:
1. Recruit 5+ independent practitioners
2. Pre-register predictions on same problem
3. Run test once
4. Calculate: (correct predictions) / (total predictions)

**This status document will be updated as validation data accumulates.**

**Transparency matters. If the framework can't meet its own validation criteria, that's diagnostic data.**
